currently: console.log(commentContent) in$(document).on("submit", ".comment-form{{entry_id}}", function(event) )
    is undefined 

V console.log commentcontent is successful

next:

V Store newly added comment to database 

still working on to display comment below entry with ajax 
- show() respective divs with correct class name or id 
- attach text to div of comment 
- add div of comment to comment list div

V done: add comment under respective entry without reloading page


May 25, 2024

next: use ajax to delete correct comment WITHOUT page reload 


May 28, 2024

V get access to comment_id with console.log when click X of comment 
V comment deleted in database after clicking X of comment. COmment gone after refresh page 

next: get comment deleted immediately after clicking X of comment 

V comment deleted immediately after clicking X of comment 

next problem: Each time a comment is submitted, next time comment is added one more time (ajax sending one more request)


Jun 6, 2024

V problem solved: Each time a comment is submitted, next time comment is added one more time (ajax sending one more request)
    why problem happened? 
        A submission event is inside a button click event.
        So each time I add comment, next time the number of comment added increases by one
        First time, comment is submitted once. Second time, submitted twice. Third time, submitted three times. 
    Solution: Just remove the line of event submission. I jsut need the click event of comment button


next problem: unable to delete newly added comments when clicking X b4 the page is reload

solution: 
V generate comment id in ajax JS, then
V use that JS generated comment id to add it to comment-commentID{{comment.comment_id}} and {{comment.comment_id}} in HTML of newly added comment in ajax
- and pass it to .py
    error: 
        File "/home/torontomet/book-app/book-app-v2.2/entryMDB.py", line 243, in add_comment
        comments = Comment.objects(comment_id=com_id)
        NameError: name 'com_id' is not defined


Jun 7, 2024

V problem solved: now able to delete newly added comments b4 reloading the page
V clear input fields after submitting comment
V make all borders of the entries, including comment sections, have the same width

next: work on recommendations page. Display articles from RSS feed.
    problem: not able to be displayed in deployment


Jun 8, 2024

V did research on issues of recommendations page
solution: link URL from front-end to .py. Fetch data of RSS Feed with python


Jun 10, 2024

manage to print url content with python, but nothing happens in JS when console.log 
V manage to display articles by using request.get(url) and .content to make HTTP request in the backend and send data to the frontend


Jun 11, 2024

V manage to use urllib.request.Request(feed_url) to display content published from BookBrowse
next: like button

Like ID manage to get generated and pass to .py then get stored in DB
But entry_id is the same as like ID, and not the entry ID of the entry
V manage to store like with correct entry_id

next problem: when click like button that is already liked, the DB has the same like with a different like ID with the same entry ID. Now I need to delete the like in the DB when like button is clicked again. 



Jun 12, 2024

remove "email-validator==2.1.0.post1" in requirements.txt


Jun 13, 2024

change "idna==3.6" to "idna==2.10"
change "requests==2.25.1" to "requests==2.32.3"


Jun 18, 2024

problem solved: manage to like and unlike in database
next problem: not yet able to change like text from blue to gray after clicking it to blue


Jun 19, 2024

problem solved: manage to change like text from blue to gray after clicking it to blue

next: 
- if entry is already liked by me, like text and icon should be blue even after reloading the page, or when first enter the page:
    - add like function def list_entries()

good: already pass like_text_color to .py

next: need to have like_text_color in def list_entries();
        color's value of like text should also be fixed, use for loop

fine: manage to pass like_text_color in def list_entries() in .py
problem still exist: entries with likes are still not having like text in blue
next sub-problem: fix color's value in HTML
    {{entry_obj.likes.like_text_color}} is incorrect
