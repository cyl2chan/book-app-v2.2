__Problem__:
According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the average American spent 23 minutes per day reading in 2004, but declined to just 16 minutes in 2019. The main reasons is that there is an increase use of technology and electronic devices, including social media and video games. 

__How this app solve the problem__:
